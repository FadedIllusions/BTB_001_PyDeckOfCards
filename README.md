# BTB_001_PyDeckOfCards

This project is a simple, CLI-based python script utilizing OOP in which a deck of text-based playing cards can be generated, shuffled, dealt, and displayed. 

As seen in the code, the Card class is used to instantiate a card of a certain suit and value and the Deck class is used to instantiate the entire deck, populated by 52 cards of 2 through Ace and Club through Spade. The deck has been given the ability to be shuffled thanks to the importation of the shuffle method of the random package, as well as the options to be dealt either card-by-card or by a given number of cards in a hand.

** Note: Project is part of the BTB (Back To The Basics) collection of projects that I've found myself doing after a stint away from coding and all things technical -- Sort of reminders to myself and a way to knock off the dust a bit before diving headfirst back into projects of my previous caliber.
